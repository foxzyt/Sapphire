## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in this project, **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, please use the GitHub [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature.

To report:
1. Go to the main page of the repository.
2. Click on **"Security"** > **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3. Fill out the form with the necessary information.

We’ll review and respond as soon as possible — usually within a few days.
