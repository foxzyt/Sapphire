## About the Project ##
### Sapphire is an compiled programming language, developed with a focus on simplicity and clarity. The project is a compiled language, focused in high speeds and high control. ###

## With Sapphire, you can: ##

### Calculate Expressions: Perform complex mathematical and logical operations. ###

### Declare Variables: Manage data flexibly with static typing. ###

### Declare functions, classes, methods, make a UI system easily, do a lot more of math operations using MathUtils, pack a script in a executable and more! ###

### Our goal is to provide an intuitive and robust development experience. ###

## Technologies Used ##
### C++: The base language for the development of Sapphire's compiler. ###

### CMake: Used to manage the project's build process. ###
